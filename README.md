# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

## Your Task

Your assignment is to modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

The application‚Äôs front end has already been created. It's your job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.


## User Story

![Note titled ‚ÄúBalance accounts‚Äù reads, ‚ÄúBalance account books by end of day Monday,‚Äù with other notes listed on the left.](./Assets/11-express-homework-demo-02.png)

## DESCRIPTION & USAGE
This application was designed to give users a place to store notes to help them organize their thoughts and to keep track of tasks they need to complete. It is powered by Express and JavaScript and implements a database using a json file (db.json) to save and retrieve data. I was responsible for connecting the backend and frontend of this application.This application is powered by Express meaning for it to function properly, there needs to be a server running in the background. To start the server, navigate to the directory of the application, install all dependencies (npm i), then type the command npm start (or node index.js). A message should then display in the command line saying "App listening at http://localhost:3001 üöÄ". Once the server is running, then navigate to the front end of the application directly from the command line by holding command and clicking the link
